I have a confession... see I had never really learned SQL. Many years ago, when I was first learning about web development with Flask and it came time to add a database, I would just google my way into an answer for whatever problem I was trying to solve (which isn't necessarily a bad thing to do when first getting started). As I dove into web development further -- experimenting with different stacks and technologies, I found ORMs and really enjoyed using them. For those who are unfamiliar, an ORM (Object Relational Mapping) is a tool that creates bindings between objects in your code to the data in your database. It aims to simplify the process of manipulating databases within a program.
ðŸ«µ Let me know what your favorite ORM is in the comments! (p.s. mine is [Prisma](https://prisma.io/))

During the last few weeks of 2023, I spent time refreshing my knowledge of SQL using [SQLBolt](https://sqlbolt.com/). SQLBolt has a free, interactive tutorial built into the site. It starts you off in the real meat and potatoes of SQL, *queries*. Queries allow you to extract only the data that you need. And let me tell you, that feeling is powerful! Each lesson has a "quiz" where you will be tasked with creating SQL statements to perform a certain task. Immediately applying the knowledge you just learned from the lesson! 
ðŸ‘€ *"Knowledge without application is meaningless."*

Consider checking out SQLBolt if you want to test or solidify your knowledge of SQL. And if you get stuck, my DMs are always open. Have a great Friday!
